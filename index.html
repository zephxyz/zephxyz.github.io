                    <p>
                        A mobile application aimed at helping users maintain a healthy work-life balance. The
                        application
                        features a
                        user login and registration system, as well as the ability to delete profiles. It includes a
                        map,
                        where
                        users
                        can identify the locations suggested by the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each day, the app generates a new challenge, which adds a
                        random point on the map at a specific distance from the user. Users can initiate the challenge
                        by
                        pressing a
                        button and choose to walk more than the minimum distance. The minimum distance increases
                        dynamically
                        with
                        the
                        number of challenges successfully completed in a row. Users can complete the challenge by
                        getting
                        within a
                        radius of 50
                        meters from the challenge point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After completing the challenge, users will be prompted to take a photo of the
                        location and will receive rewards in the form of "fire" symbols, which represent the number of
                        challenges
                        completed in a row.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The app also allows users to initiate a new challenge after completing the previous one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Users can access help and instructions on how to use the app, and can set reminders to prepare
                        for
                        the next
                        challenge or take a break. Overall, the goal of the project is to develop an application that
                        helps
                        users
                        maintain a healthy work-life balance through activities designed in the app. The app is
                        developed
                        using
                        Flutter and Firebase.

                        Binary Search Tree Database is designed to store and manage information about people, including
                        their name,
                        and
                        date of birth (year, month, and day). The database is built using a binary search tree data
                        structure that
                        allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of records.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The system is designed to make it easy to add new records to the database. When a new record is
                        added, the
                        system automatically places it in the appropriate location in the tree based on the date of
                        birth
                        and name
                        of
                        the individual.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Searching for a particular record in the database is also straightforward. The user simply
                        enters
                        the date
                        of
                        birth (year, month, and day) and name of the individual they are looking for, and the system
                        quickly
                        retrieves
                        the corresponding record from the database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to searching and adding records, the system also allows for the deletion of records.
                        When a
                        record
                        is deleted, the system automatically removes the corresponding node from the binary search tree,
                        keeping the
                        database organized and efficient.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Overall, my Binary Search Tree Database project is a useful tool for managing information
                        about
                        people,
                        making
                        it easy to find, store, and delete records quickly and efficiently.

                    <p>
                        Shortest Maze Path Finder uses a combination of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and an adjacency
                        list to find
                        the shortest path through a maze. The user inputs the maze directly through standard input
                        (stdin),
                        where '#'
                        marks a wall and '.' marks a path. The input is split into two parts: the first part is the maze
                        itself, and is
                        terminated by a '-' character. The second part is the start and end nodes of the maze, which are
                        entered as
                        indexes ([start-row] [start-column] [end-row] [end-column]).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The BFS algorithm is used to explore the maze, starting from the entrance and moving outwards in
                        all
                        directions
                        until the end node is found. This approach is effective in finding the shortest path through the
                        maze, as it
                        considers all possible paths and selects the shortest one. As the algorithm moves through the
                        maze,
                        it keeps
                        track of the distance traveled along each path.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To efficiently explore the maze and keep track of the paths taken, the algorithm uses an
                        adjacency
                        list, which
                        represents the connections between each point in the maze. This allows the algorithm to easily
                        determine which
                        paths to follow and which ones to avoid, ensuring that the shortest path is always found.

                        In the second part of the input, the user enters the indexes of the start and end nodes. The
                        algorithm then uses
                        the BFS and adjacency list to find the shortest path between these two nodes. Traversing an edge
                        in
                        the graph
                        adds 1 to the distance traveled, and the returning value of the algorithm is the distance of the
                        shortest path.

                        Overall, my Shortest Maze Path Finder is a useful tool for navigating through complex
                        mazes,
                        and
                        its efficient use of BFS and an adjacency list makes it a reliable and effective way to find the
                        shortest path
                        through any given maze.

                        A web page that compiles all the changes introduced in League of Legends' 12.23 patch. The page
                        is
                        designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with easy navigation and a clean, professional
                        layout. Each
                        change
                        is presented on a separate page, with clear headings and descriptions that detail the
                        modifications made to
                        the
                        game.

                        The page is organized by categories, making it easy for users to find specific changes that
                        interest them.
                        The
                        categories include champions, items, runes, and more. Each page also includes a brief summary of
                        the
                        changes, as
                        well as a more detailed breakdown of what players can expect.

                        One of the main goals of the project is to make it easier for League of Legends players to stay
                        up-to-date
                        on
                        the latest changes in the game. This information is crucial for players who want to maintain
                        their
                        competitive
                        edge and stay on top of the current meta. By providing a centralized location for all of the
                        changes
                        introduced
                        in the 12.23 patch, players can quickly and easily access the information they need.
